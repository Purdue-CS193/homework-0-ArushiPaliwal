# Arushi Paliwal's First CS193 Homework

- I like CS193 because it teaches us how to use different softwares which aren't taught in other classes usch as Github, Git.
- We get to learn about Unix/Linux and terminal commands.
- Get introduced to various tools which are essential for projects, software devlopment, etc.
